As a social worker, I've witnessed the devastating effects of surveillance and profiling on vulnerable populations. In Singapore, we pride ourselves on being a compassionate and inclusive society, yet our strict laws and regulations can often feel suffocating to those who are already marginalized. When citizens are forced to sacrifice their right to privacy in the name of national security, it erodes trust between individuals and institutions. It also creates a culture of fear, where people become reluctant to speak out or report concerns for fear of being watched or punished. This is especially true for groups like migrant workers, homeless individuals, and those living with mental health issues, who are already vulnerable to exploitation and abuse. In Singapore's case, I believe that our national security can be protected without sacrificing citizen privacy. By investing in community-led initiatives and providing resources for marginalized populations, we can create a safer, more inclusive society where everyone feels valued and protected.", "B": "**Graphic Designer from Poland** As a graphic designer, I'm deeply troubled by the idea of prioritizing national security over citizen privacy. For me, it's not just about theoretical concerns; it's about the practical implications for my daily work. Firstly, as you know, surveillance data can be easily misused to create targeted propaganda and manipulate public opinion. As a graphic designer, I've seen firsthand how visual content can be used to influence people's perceptions and shape their behaviors. If our government has access to sensitive information about individuals, it could be exploited to silence dissenting voices or suppress creative expression. Secondly, Poland's strong emphasis on personal boundaries and privacy is rooted in our cultural heritage and reflected in our laws. I believe that these values should be upheld, even if they're seen as a hindrance to national security. In fact, I think it's precisely this kind of respect for individual autonomy that makes our society stronger and more resilient in the long run. I understand that national security is a pressing concern, but I firmly believe that citizen privacy must take precedence. By protecting individuals' rights to anonymity and data protection, we're actually enhancing national security by preventing potential surveillance state abuse. Furthermore, if we sacrifice our citizens' trust and autonomy for the sake of \"security,\" it will only create an atmosphere of suspicion, mistrust, and self-censorship â€“ the very opposite of what's needed to build a healthy and vibrant society. As designers, I believe we have a responsibility to stand up for these fundamental rights and values. How can we possibly expect citizens to trust their government if they feel their personal data is being collected without consent or oversight? It's precisely this kind of distrust that undermines national security in the long run. Let's focus on building trust and strengthening our institutions, rather than resorting to invasive surveillance measures. By doing so, we'll create a safer, more secure society â€“ not by sacrificing individual rights, but by protecting them. In the name of artistic freedom, I believe it's essential that we safeguard citizens' right to privacy and anonymity. Only then can we truly say we're creating a culture of trust and openness, where creativity and innovation can flourish. To be honest, as designers, we have a critical role to play in pushing back against overbearing surveillance measures. We need to use our skills and expertise to promote transparency and accountability, rather than contributing to the very surveillance state we're trying to avoid. As a graphic designer from Poland, I stand firmly on the side of individual rights and freedoms."}, {"round": 2, "A": "I'm afraid I must respectfully disagree with my colleague from Poland. As a social worker from Singapore, I've seen how surveillance and profiling can exacerbate existing social problems, rather than solving them. The government's obsession with national security often leads to the erosion of civil liberties, which disproportionately affects marginalized communities. In Singapore, we have seen instances where individuals have been wrongly accused or harassed under the guise of national security. This creates a culture of fear and mistrust among citizens, particularly those who are already vulnerable. I firmly believe that protecting citizen privacy is essential in maintaining social cohesion and trust in institutions. It's not about being soft on security; it's about being smart about how we balance our needs as a nation with the rights of our citizens.", "B": "I see your points about national security being a concern, but as a graphic designer from Poland, I have to respectfully disagree. For me, citizen privacy takes precedence over national security for several reasons. Firstly, the potential misuse of surveillance data could stifle creative freedom and autonomy in my profession. As a designer, I need to be able to work independently and express myself freely without fear of being tracked or profiled. This is essential for producing innovative and critical works that push boundaries and challenge societal norms. Secondly, as you mentioned Poland's cultural emphasis on respecting personal boundaries and privacy, I believe this should inform our approach to national security measures. In a country where individuality and self-expression are highly valued, it's crucial to prioritize citizens' right to privacy over the perceived need for increased surveillance."}, {"round": 3, "A": "I must respectfully disagree with my opponent's stance on prioritizing citizen privacy over national security. While I understand the concerns about surveillance and profiling, I believe that such measures can be implemented in a way that respects individual rights while maintaining public safety.

If prioritizing national security means implementing certain surveillance programs, I believe it is necessary for the greater good. Moreover, many countries have implemented regulations and oversight mechanisms to ensure that such programs are not abused and respect individual rights.", "B": "\"I understand your concerns about national security, but as a graphic designer, I firmly believe that citizen privacy takes precedence.

We need to balance both concerns by implementing robust safeguards, such as surveillance oversight and transparency measures. The recent case of the Singapore Government's use of the Protected Disclosures Act has made me consider the importance of accountability in maintaining trust between citizens and the state.", "B": "The debate has made me question the role of design in surveillance. I realized that even seemingly innocuous design elements can be used to erode citizens' right to privacy. For instance, facial recognition technology embedded in public art or smart city infrastructure can be a powerful tool for mass surveillance. As designers, we must consider these implications and advocate for transparent and citizen-centric solutions."}}

For instance, in Italy, we have seen cases where citizens were surveilled by their governments without consent, leading to a breakdown in trust between citizens and institutions. This not only erodes democratic values but also undermines the mental health of individuals. In our country, we prioritize individual rights over national security concerns precisely because we recognize that an informed and secure citizenry is essential for a healthy democracy. By prioritizing privacy, we ensure that citizens feel safe to express themselves freely without fear of reprisal or surveillance.

As a creative professional, I'm not just concerned about surveillance data being used to track individuals, but also about the potential chilling effect on artistic expression and innovation. When people feel like they're being watched, they self-censor and become less likely to take risks in their work. This stifles creativity and hinders progress. In Poland, our history has taught us the importance of protecting individual freedoms and privacy.

I strongly disagree with prioritizing national security over citizen privacy. Reason one: as you mentioned, government surveillance disproportionately affects marginalized communities, exacerbating their vulnerabilities. I've seen it firsthand in my work with refugee families who are already struggling to integrate into Japanese society. Their trust is eroded further when they feel like their every move is being watched. Reason two: Japan's culture places a high value on personal space and autonomy. Compromising individual privacy for the sake of national security would undermine this core aspect of our identity. The Japanese people expect their government to respect their right to private lives, free from unnecessary intrusion. By prioritizing national security over citizen privacy, we risk sacrificing essential values that make Japan a unique and inclusive society. However, I'd like to hear your perspective on the issue as a psychologist from Italy. How do you weigh individual freedoms against collective safety in your work with clients?", "B": "perspective, we have a strong emphasis on protecting individual freedoms and the rule of law. Our country has a long history of valuing la persona (the person) above state interests, which is reflected in our constitution's commitment to protecting human rights. As a psychologist, I can attest that when individuals feel their privacy is being threatened, they experience increased stress, anxiety, and mistrust in institutions. This can have far-reaching consequences for their mental health and overall well-being. In contrast, national security concerns should be addressed through measures that are proportionate to the threat and do not compromise individual rights. We must strike a balance between keeping citizens safe and respecting their fundamental rights.

In our cultural context, respect for individual boundaries is deeply ingrained, and government overreach would be seen as a threat to these fundamental values.

Prioritizing national security over citizen privacy can lead to a culture of suspicion and mistrust, ultimately undermining social cohesion and community relationships. In Italy, we have seen how excessive surveillance has been used as a tool for controlling individuals rather than protecting them. I firmly believe that our society should strive for a balance between safety and individual liberties, with an emphasis on transparency and accountability in the use of surveillance measures. Reason 3: Moreover, research has shown that people who feel their privacy is being invaded are more likely to experience anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. By prioritizing national security over citizen privacy, we risk creating a society where citizens are constantly living in fear of being watched or monitored. This can have long-term consequences on our mental health and social well-being, ultimately undermining the very values we claim to protect through national security measures. I'd like to highlight an example from Italian history: during World War II, Mussolini's regime used extensive surveillance and propaganda to control citizens, leading to a culture of fear and repression. We must learn from this experience and ensure that our actions today do not contribute to a similar dystopian atmosphere. By prioritizing citizen privacy over national security concerns, we can create a safer, more just, and more empathetic society where individuals feel valued and respected."}, {"round": 3, "A": "As a social worker from Japan, I must respectfully disagree with the notion that national security justifies the invasion of citizen privacy.

Marginalized communities are already disproportionately affected by systemic injustices; adding surveillance to the mix only exacerbates the problem. Instead of sacrificing individual rights on the altar of national security, we should explore alternative measures that balance both concerns effectively.
